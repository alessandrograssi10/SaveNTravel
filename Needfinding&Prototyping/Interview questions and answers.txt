Answers:


Interview 1
1. I've been on several trips during my lifetime, when I was single, with friends (in Finland in 1997, in Lithuania 2 years before) and other times with my family (2019 in Egypt, 2022 in Montenegro, 2023 in Kyrgyzstan) I've had quite many business trips alone around Kazakhstan. 
2. Finding the right time for a trip which would suit all people, buying tickets and finding suitable accommodation 
3. When going to Kyrgyzstan with both friends and family, it took us a long time to decide on the transport we'd use and the best time. The majority chose a night flight since it was cheaper, so I had to agree.
4. My personal travel experience helps me to find good options at cheaper prices. I use special websites, google and consult people who have traveled to other countries. 
5. If we have common purchases, then we split them right there while buying them. We don't split personal purchases.
6. I always tell friends beforehand that we split money right away, since we might forget about it later, and things can become complicated. 
7. During the trip, it's more convenient. Not all receipts might be saved, and you may feel  uncomfortable writing things down, friends might get offended.
8. Planning a trip in advance helps. I write down the main points like a visa, tickets, accommodation, food and entertainment. Then next to it I put a tick after I find suitable options, and write  approximate expenses. 
9. I save money by renting an apartment, not in the city center probably, and cooking my own food. I choose 2 or 3 tours around the place, not many. I don't buy many souvenirs and don't take too many clothes.
10. I mainly use Skyscanner, booking.com. So far no complaints. 
11. That would be very convenient if currency exchange rates were not high. Of course, using this kind of application may cause a risk, but with safeguards, risks are much fewer.
12. Always choose reliable travel providers. For example, kiwi.com offers very cheap flights but they may not return money in case of flight cancellation. However, the website can be used for choosing good travel options and then you can use more reliable providers with the same options. 
13. You can always find the best options at cheaper prices, though it takes time. So maybe your app will offer such options.



Interview 2
1. Yes, I have gone on several trips both with friends and alone
2. The trickiest aspect is deciding on a budget, a schedule that works for everyone, and a place that everyone is excited about
3. No, since we've already chosen what we're going to do that day.
4. Yes, controlling the budget may be difficult, especially when unexpected costs arise. It is essential to have a backup plan.
5. No, everyone pays individually
6. it depends on the person but in the same day or the end of the trip
7. I like to complete my accounting throughout the trip. This way, I can keep track of my spending and ensure that I stay within my budget.
8. I begin by looking at the prices of hotels, transportation, food, and entertainment. Always keep some additional money on hand in case of unexpected events.
9. I try to eat at local restaurants rather than pricey tourist attractions and I look for affordable accommodations because you'll be spending the majority of your time exploring outside.
10. yes like tripadvisor, booking.com
11. Yes, however it depends on how trustworthy the app is. 
12. Try to reserve accommodation and flights as early as possible and make well planned trip or programme
13. to collaborate with hotels and vacation programs so that we have some deals.



Interview 3
1. Yes, I traveled both with friends and alone, my last trip was a month ago.
2. The most challenging aspect of coordination travel plans for me is availability of all the members of the group.
3. I have not encountered such a situation.
4. No, I don't
5. Yes, I keep and divide purchases in my head and also use the Revolut bank app
6. Instantly or after couple of days
7. More often I do it after the trip
8. I check the prices for everything (air/train tickets, accommodation, food etc.)
9. I use student discounts
10. No, I don't
11. If this application will be accepted by the app platforms such as AppStore or Google Play, i will trust it
12. It's better to organize them with another people in person, because it will be easier to exchange the ideas or to change your plans for the trip
13. I don't have anything to share



Interview 4
Yes, I have done both trips with friends and alone. The last trip was August 2023.
Find suitable dates for the whole group and book in time to avoid sudden changes in costs.
Yes, absolutely, yes. Both in terms of money and activity choices.
Yes, we have often had to review the budget we set for the trip because we had not foreseen all possible costs before the holiday.
Yes, I use an application called SplitWise , where the settlement of credits or debits takes place outside the application. The application helps to keep the calculations.
It depends, I tend to try to do it as soon as possible, but not everyone is like that; therefore, it can even take two or three weeks.
I try to keep track of the costs I am incurring starting from flights and accommodation , which I do before the trip and are the most substantial expenses. After that I try to keep a daily track.
I start with flight + hotel and then establish a daily budget which can include visits, food and entertainment.
I prefer to save on restaurants, choosing cheaper things for lunch and dinner.
Yes, I used SplitWise , which is an app that helps you keep accounts that you do as a group, where whoever supports the common expense updates the payments on the application, which automatically divides by the number of participants.
Yes, I would be interested and I would be comfortable sharing because today there are many ways to keep payments tracked and secure, so if the application were to stay within these deadlines, I would have no problems.
Structure a pre -departure budget, monitor it during the trip, and add an important percentage of unexpected costs into the budget structure.
Settling the accounts directly on the app and not doing it outside would be interesting, because it would guarantee the balance of payments during the holiday with simple methods, also because today not everyone uses the same applications to transfer money, so perhaps one is not registered with a type of circuit like Paypal or Revolut . It would be useful to not carry around debts or credits for weeks to have a fusion between the SplitWise and payment functions.
 
Interview 5
Yes, with friends in April.
Definitely the budget.
I agreed to share a bed with a friend of mine to save money.
Sometimes yes.
Yes, via an app.
As long as they remember to send me the bank transfers.
During the trip, entering them on the app.
I check the expenses on the card daily.
I prefer to save on everything other than food and entertainment.
splitwise expense division .
I would be interested and quite comfortable if it uses payment methods I trust such as PayPal and if it was certified I suppose .
Have a lot of patience and buy the family pack shampoo once you get there so we can all use it.
 
Interview  6
Yes, with friends, this year.
In my opinion, the division of expenses is very complicated.
No, nothing comes to mind.
Yes definitely.
Joint expenses are paid in advance by one person and then at the end of the trip a calculation is made of who owes whom.
Some day.
During the trip.
I set myself a daily budget and try not to exceed it. If one day I go overboard the next day I try to counterbalance .
I try to go to sleep in cheap places.
I used SplitWise to split expenses, it's great.
I think I can be very useful, but I don't know if I would use it.
Talk about the budget of common expenses first so as not to have misunderstandings later.
 
Interview 7
Yes. Both. I’m an adventurer. Last time was a month ago.
Availabilities and inequal wealth.
I had exams and I came later alone to join the group. Numerous lonely hours of travel but always worth it.
Yes, depends on the trip.
Yes. When we are more than 2, we just open a tricount (app) so we’re not lost in the counts.
Couple of days in the best scenario. I have a friend who owes me more than 200€ from 4 years though.
We take notes during the trip. We’re comfortable with that so no problem.
I see how much I can take with me before and I just adapt myself with that during the trip.
I’m not into fancy or luxury stuff so pretty easy to save money. Always start by asking locals all kind of essential info. Usually save while choosing the Airbnb/hotel or the cheapest thing in a restaurant. Sometimes I authorize myself some exception.
Tricount, Revolut. Great tools.
Very interested. No problem sharing my info.
Communication and trust. Avoid surprises right on the spot.
In my opinion, the biggest parameters to organize a trip is the size of the group and how much we know the location. Can really influence the savings.
 
Interview 8
Yes, I have been traveling with friends and the last time was two years ago.
challenging aspects are looking for a destination that suits everyone, speaking of interests and budget. It's difficult to reserve a seat using a single payment method. It's also difficult to find a time to all meet together to make a reservation.
Yes, I had to make compromises. Although I like going to hotels, I have had to follow my companions to other types of establishments. I also had to settle for some goals, which I didn't appreciate too much. Furthermore, we often went over budget.
I've always encountered lots of problems: there are those who wanted to spend more and those less and for different things. Some wanted to spend more on hotels or restaurants and some wanted to spend on attractions or visits instead.
Yes, I share the expenses when traveling. The problem is that spending is often not fair, especially when the expenses are minimal, because they are not repaid, but in the end, adding them up over time, they end up being more substantial expenses. The expenses that are made even before leaving are also complicated to manage, such as for the overnight stay, where there is always someone who has to pay a high sum of money and the money will be returned over time and sometimes a little more or less , sometimes in cash, sometimes in paper and sometimes in installments.
Sometimes it can even take years.
I never do them, neither during nor after.
I start from the flight, choosing the destination. I choose the flight and destination first and from there I understand how much I want to spend on the rest, therefore hotels and life. I use platforms like SkyScanner or Booking where you can put a maximum price range.
Personally, I prefer to save on flights, for example by traveling at night, and on hotels, preferring life, visits etc.
Yes, I use SkyScanner and Booking to choose flights and hotels based on my budget. To split expenses, I use Revolut to transfer money. My experience with Revolut is semi-positive because not many people have it.
Yes, absolutely. I would feel comfortable sharing my payment information.
More compromises.
I would like joint expenses to be split automatically and instantly.
 
Interview 9
Yes, I left and last time was with friends for New Year 2024.
There are various challenging aspects of organizing a trip:
-            Meet and evaluate the goal
-            Agree on payment methods
-            Agree on the budget
I had to go on holiday to places I don't like. I had to spend more than my budget.
I always want to go to hotels with a gym, while for others it is not important. I have happened to travel with those who were too wasteful or those who wanted to save too much, instead of making compromises in both cases.
Yes, I often have to pay for common expenses and sometimes the money doesn't come back to me, either due to forgetfulness or because sometimes the expense is minimal.
I'm still waiting for the money I lent and I don't know if it will reach me.
I don't look at expenses, because basically I always go over budget.
Unfortunately, I'm never the one organizing the trips, so I'm happy with other people's choices and then plan the rest of the budget based on the initial expenses.
I prefer to save on diners and life and I prefer to spend on flights, because I don't like traveling at night and ruining the first days of the trip.
I don't use apps.
Yes, I would have no problem sharing my data.
Nothing in particular, I still have difficulty dividing my budget and expenses.

CHATGPT INTERVIEW:
Request:
hi, I'm building an app called 'SaveNTravel' which aims to help groups of people to financially organize their trips. We were thinking about an app that will give you the opportunity to set the different budgets for different categories such as flight, accommodation, food, visits, museums, nightlife etc, that will give you the chance to change it during the trip and that will also give you the chance to set an error percentage on these budgets. The app will also have a section for the common expenses, where the app will calculate how much money a person owes to another etc. We would like to understand if what we have thought could be helpful and if there is something we are missing and that we should add. So we are interviewing people. Could you answer our interview, basing your answer on a person that could actually use an app like this. So could you first describe the kind of person you would be by answering our interview and give us possible answers, please.
Answer:
Yes, I've been on several trips, mostly with friends or family. I've traveled to various destinations, both domestically and internationally, over the past few years.
One of the most challenging aspects is aligning everyone's schedules and preferences. It can be tricky to find a destination that appeals to everyone and to coordinate flights, accommodations, and activities that suit everyone's budgets and interests.
Certainly, there have been instances where I've had to compromise on my preferred activities or destinations to ensure everyone in the group was satisfied. For example, choosing a restaurant that caters to different dietary preferences or opting for a less expensive accommodation option to accommodate everyone's budget.
Yes, managing the budget can be challenging, especially when traveling with friends who may have different spending habits or financial constraints. It's essential to establish clear communication and expectations regarding expenses from the outset.
Yes, we often split expenses like meals, transportation, and accommodations. We usually use a combination of cash and mobile payment apps to settle shared expenses.
It varies depending on the situation, but we try to settle shared expenses as soon as possible to avoid any confusion or misunderstandings. Typically, it's within a day or two.
I prefer to keep track of expenses during the trip, using either a dedicated app or a spreadsheet. It helps me stay within budget and ensures I'm aware of how much I'm spending in real-time.
I start by estimating the total cost of the trip, including flights, accommodations, food, activities, and incidentals. Then, I allocate a specific budget for each category and try to stick to it by monitoring my expenses closely throughout the trip.
 I look for deals on flights and accommodations, opt for public transportation instead of taxis, and try to eat at local eateries rather than touristy restaurants. I also prioritize free or low-cost activities and attractions.
Yes, I've used budgeting apps and expense trackers to manage my finances while traveling. They've been helpful in keeping me organized and ensuring I stay within budget.
Yes, I would be interested in such a feature, especially if it simplifies the process of splitting expenses with friends. However, I would want to ensure that the app has robust security measures in place to protect my payment information.
Communication is key when traveling with a group. It's essential to discuss expectations, budgets, and preferences upfront to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts during the trip.
One suggestion would be to incorporate features that allow users to set and track shared expenses easily. Additionally, providing real-time updates on spending and customizable budget categories would be beneficial for users looking to manage their finances effectively while traveling with others.

hi, I'm building an app called 'SaveNTravel' which aims to help groups of people to organise their trips financially.

Answer:
Interview with a Potential User of SaveNTravel
Yes, I travel frequently with friends. In fact, I just got back from a backpacking trip through Southeast Asia with two college buddies last month (April 2024).
The most challenging aspects are definitely:
Finding a destination and dates that work for everyone's budget and schedule.
Agreeing on accommodation that meets everyone's needs (luxury vs. budget-friendly).
Balancing activities that everyone wants to do, especially when interests differ.
On the recent Southeast Asia trip, I really wanted to spend a few days exploring off-the-beaten-path islands, but my friends preferred the more touristy beaches. We ended up splitting our time between both to find a happy medium.
Yes, it can be tricky. Often people have different spending habits, and it's easy to lose track of shared expenses, especially for smaller things like meals and transportation.
Absolutely. We usually try to pay for things individually when possible, but for group meals, taxis, or entrance fees, one person pays upfront and then we settle up later. This can be messy, with someone constantly having to calculate who owes what.
It can be awkward! Sometimes it takes weeks to settle everything, especially if someone forgets or there are disagreements about amounts.
I try to keep a loose track of expenses during the trip, but a more detailed accounting usually happens after I return home, which can be time-consuming and frustrating.
I research average costs for flights, accommodation, and activities in advance. Then, I factor in a buffer for unexpected expenses.  Unfortunately, sticking to the budget isn't always perfect, especially with group activities.
I look for budget-friendly accommodation options like hostels or guesthouses.
I try to cook some meals at our accommodation to avoid expensive restaurant bills every day.
When it comes to activities, I prioritize free attractions and walking tours over expensive excursions.
I've tried a couple of budgeting apps, but none were specifically designed for group trips. They were okay for personal budgeting, but not helpful for managing shared expenses or group activities.
Yes, that would be a very useful feature!  Sharing payment information would depend on the app's security measures. If it has a strong reputation and secure transactions, I would be comfortable using it.
Clear communication from the beginning is key! Discussing budgets, expectations, and desired activities openly helps avoid conflicts later.
Having a flexible itinerary allows room for compromise and spontaneous adventures.
Keeping track of shared expenses meticulously throughout the trip is crucial to avoid post-trip headaches.


- The ability to set individual and group budgets would be fantastic.
- An expense tracker that allows splitting costs with friends directly in the app would be a huge timesaver.
- Real-time updates on how much each person has spent compared to the budget would promote responsible spending within the group.
- Integration with popular money transfer services would be ideal for easy settling of shared expenses.
I believe SaveNTravel sounds like a great app idea, and with the features you've mentioned, it could be a game-changer for group travel planning and budgeting.
