Our team has developed an innovative fintech app designed to streamline the financial management of group travel with friends. The project involved several key phases:

1. **Storyboarding:** We mapped out user journeys and interactions to ensure a smooth and intuitive experience.
2. **Interviews:** We conducted interviews to gather insights and understand user needs and pain points.
3. **Prototyping:** We created interactive prototypes to visualize and test our design concepts.
4. **Development:** We implemented the final app using Swift on Xcode, focusing on creating a robust and user-friendly solution for tracking and managing shared expenses during group trips.

Our app aims to simplify financial settlement and enhance the travel experience by making group budgeting and expense tracking effortless.
